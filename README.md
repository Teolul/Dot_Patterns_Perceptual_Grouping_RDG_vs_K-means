# Dot Patterns Perceptual Grouping: RDG vs K-means

Repository for the Principles and Models of Perception project, addressing the human perception of Dot Patterns through the laws of the Gestalt and their algorithmic reproduction.\
Furthermore, an implementation of G. Papari and N. Petkov's algorithm is proposed. This is used to compute and show a Reduced Delaunay Graph that approximates how a human perceives Dot Patterns. The implementation is based on Papari and Petkov's paper "Algorithm That Mimics Human Perceptual Grouping of Dot Patterns" for the Institute of Mathematics and Computing Science in the University of Groningen.\
A summarized explanation of the algorithm, among other things, can be found in the presentation file in this repository.\

## Libraries used:

numpy

scipy

matplotlib

sklearn

## Instructions:

In notebook.ipynb execute all the code snippets from the beginning.

The following paragraphs explain the various functions in the notebook. To avoid repetition, here are explained the most common parameters that can be found:

- points (np.array): the number of points considered for generating or plotting a dataset.
- noise_factor (float): how much the points are scattered in generating a dataset.

`generate_face(points, noise_factor=0.01):`

- Computes a point dataset in the shape of a face with two eyes and a mouth.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.
  - noise_factor: see above.

`generate_spiral(points, turns=2, noise_factor=0.01):`

- Computes a point dataset in the shape of two intertwined spirals.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.
  - turns (int): the number of turns in the spirals. The larger this parameter is, the longer and complex the spiral is.
  - noise_factor: see above.

`plot_points(points):`

- Shows a scatter plot from the point dataset passed as parameter.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.

`delaunay_triangulation(points):`

- Shows a Delaunay Triangulation plot from the point dataset passed as parameter.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.

`rdg_compute(points, threshold=2.5):`

- Computes a Reduced Delaunay Graph from the point dataset passed as parameter using Papari and Petkov's algorithm.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.
  - threshold (float or string):
    - if it's a positive number, it's used as a static threshold for the values in the map.
    - if it's "mean", a dynamic threshold is computed based on the mean of the values in the edge map.
    - if it's "area", a dynamic threshold is computed based on the area of the smallest enclosing circle of all the points.

`kmeans_clustering(points, n_clusters):`

- Computes k-means clustering on the point dataset passed as parameter.
- Parameters:
  - points: see above.
  - n_clusters (int): the number of clusters to detect for the k-means algorithm.

Further explanations of what the various functions do can be found in the comments inside the notebook.\
The various point datasets can be generated by executing the function and the corresponding snippet with the function call.\
Then, the generated datasets can be used as parameters for the four plotting functions (plot_points, delaunay_triangulation, rdg_compute, kmeans_clustering). Tweaking the thresholds and other parameters is recommended to achieve better results.\
Other point datasets in the form of a numpy array can be used to see other results.
